React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components by allowing state and lifecycle methods in functional components.

## Core Hooks

### useState
Manage local component state in functional components.

### useEffect
Handle side effects and lifecycle events.

### useContext
Access context values without prop drilling.

## Custom Hooks

Create reusable stateful logic across components.
