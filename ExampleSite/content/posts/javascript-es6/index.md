ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced many powerful features that transformed JavaScript development.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions.

## Template Literals

Template literals make string interpolation much easier and more readable.

## Destructuring

Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays and objects in a clean way.

## Modules

ES6 modules provide a standardized way to organize and share code between files.
