When it comes to CSS layout, developers often wonder whether to use CSS Grid or Flexbox. Both are powerful tools, but they serve different purposes.

## CSS Grid

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that excels at creating complex layouts with both rows and columns.

## Flexbox

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method that's perfect for distributing space and aligning items in a single direction.

## When to Use Which?

Choose based on your layout needs and complexity requirements.
